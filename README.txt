## Requirements
The code requires the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas` (if used in the code)
- `matplotlib` (if used in the code)

Ensure these libraries are installed before running the code. If not, install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Recommended Environment
It is recommended to use Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code to run the `.ipynb` files. Install Jupyter with:

Alternatively, you can use VS Code with the Jupyter extension.

### Steps to Run

1. **Open the Notebook**
   - Open `Question1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook Question1.ipynb
     ```
   - Alternatively, open the file in VS Code and ensure the Python environment is properly configured.

2. **Load the Data**
   - Place your data files in the following paths:

	- './resized_images' for question 1
     	- `./mnist` for question 2
	
	if you use another paths for data please make relevant changes on code.

3. **Run All Cells**
   - In Jupyter Notebook, select **Kernel** > **Restart & Run All** to execute all cells sequentially.
   - In VS Code, use the Run Cell option for each cell or execute the entire notebook.
